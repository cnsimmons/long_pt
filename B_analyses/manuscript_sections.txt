METHODS

Participants
We analyzed longitudinal fMRI data from 24 participants: 6 with occipitotemporal 
cortex (OTC) resections (mean age at first scan = 13.7 ± 3.4 years, 4 males), 
9 with non-OTC resections (mean age = 14.8 ± 2.5 years, 4 males), and 9 
typically developing controls (mean age = 11.7 ± 2.3 years, 5 males). All 
patients underwent surgical resection for treatment-resistant epilepsy. OTC 
resections involved ventral temporal cortex (fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal 
gyrus, and/or parahippocampal gyrus), while non-OTC resections spared these 
regions. Participants underwent two scanning sessions (mean interval: OTC = 
0.90 ± 0.33 years, non-OTC = 1.22 ± 0.64 years, controls = 1.81 ± 1.30 years). 
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board, and written 
informed consent was obtained from participants and/or guardians.

MRI Data Acquisition
Functional MRI data were acquired on 3T Siemens scanners (Verio or Prisma) 
using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequences. Participants completed a 
visual category localizer task viewing images from four categories: faces, 
words, objects, and houses, presented in blocked design with scrambled images 
as baseline. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired for 
registration and ROI definition.

Preprocessing
Functional data were preprocessed using FSL (FMRIB Software Library v6.0). 
Preprocessing included motion correction (MCFLIRT), slice-timing correction, 
spatial smoothing (5mm FWHM Gaussian kernel), high-pass temporal filtering 
(100s cutoff), and registration to subject-specific anatomical space using 
boundary-based registration (BBR). All sessions for each participant were 
registered to their first session anatomical scan to maintain spatial 
correspondence across timepoints.

First-level analyses modeled category-evoked responses using the general linear 
model, with separate regressors for each visual category convolved with a 
canonical hemodynamic response function. Motion parameters were included as 
nuisance regressors. Contrast images (category > scrambled baseline) were 
generated for each category.

ROI Definition
Region-of-interest (ROI) definition followed a two-stage process combining 
anatomical constraint with functional localization. First, anatomical search 
regions were defined using the Desikan-Killiany atlas from FreeSurfer automatic 
parcellation. Category-specific search regions comprised: fusiform gyrus (faces, 
words), lateral occipital cortex (objects), and combined parahippocampal gyrus, 
lingual gyrus, and isthmus cingulate (houses). These parcels were resampled to 
functional space and dilated by one iteration to accommodate individual anatomical 
variability.

Second, functional ROIs were extracted for each category by thresholding the 
category > scrambled contrast at z > 2.3 and intersecting with the anatomical 
search region. The largest contiguous cluster (minimum 50 voxels) was selected 
as the functional ROI. This procedure was performed independently for each 
session, allowing ROIs to reflect session-specific functional organization while 
remaining anatomically constrained to the same search region across sessions.

For controls, ROIs were extracted bilaterally. For patients, ROIs were extracted 
from the intact (non-resected) hemisphere only.

Representational Similarity Analysis
We quantified representational change across sessions using representational 
similarity analysis (RSA). For each functional ROI, we extracted β-values for 
all category conditions from the first-level GLM. We then computed pattern 
similarity using Pearson correlation between each category's pattern and all 
other categories' patterns, yielding a representational dissimilarity matrix 
(RDM) for each session.

Representational distinctiveness was quantified using Liu et al.'s method, 
which measures how dissimilar a category's pattern is from other categories. 
Specifically, for each category, we computed: distinctiveness = 1 - mean(r_ij), 
where r_ij represents the correlation between the target category i and each 
other category j. Higher distinctiveness indicates more category-specific 
representations.

Longitudinal representational change was calculated as the absolute difference 
in distinctiveness values between sessions: |distinctiveness_session2 - 
distinctiveness_session1|. This metric quantifies how much a category's 
representational distinctiveness changed over time, regardless of direction.

Statistical Analysis
Visual categories were classified as bilateral (objects, houses) or unilateral 
(faces, words) based on typical hemispheric lateralization in neurotypical 
adults. For each participant, we computed mean representational change separately 
for bilateral and unilateral categories.

Primary analyses tested whether the bilateral advantage (bilateral minus unilateral 
representational change) differed between groups using independent-samples t-tests. 
Within-group paired t-tests assessed whether bilateral categories showed greater 
change than unilateral categories. We computed Cohen's d effect sizes for all 
comparisons.

Given the small sample size in the OTC group (n=6), we performed comprehensive 
robustness checks including: (1) non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank for 
within-group, Mann-Whitney U for between-group comparisons), (2) permutation 
tests (10,000 iterations), (3) bootstrap confidence intervals (10,000 iterations), 
and (4) leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. All tests were two-tailed with 
α = 0.05.

To decompose the mechanism underlying group differences in bilateral advantage, 
we separately compared groups on bilateral and unilateral category representational 
change using independent-samples t-tests.

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics
The final sample comprised 24 participants across three groups (Table 1). Groups 
did not differ significantly in age at first scan (one-way ANOVA: F(2,21) = 1.89, 
p = 0.176) or sex distribution (χ² = 0.27, p = 0.873). Time between scanning 
sessions differed across groups (F(2,21) = 3.85, p = 0.037), with controls having 
longer intervals than patients; however, scan interval did not correlate with 
representational change magnitude in any group (all |r| < 0.35, all p > 0.20).

Bilateral Advantage in Visual Category Representations
We first tested whether bilateral visual categories (objects, houses) showed 
greater longitudinal representational change than unilateral categories (faces, 
words) within each group. In the OTC group, bilateral categories exhibited 
significantly greater representational change (M = 0.419, SD = 0.149) compared 
to unilateral categories (M = 0.135, SD = 0.057; paired t(5) = 3.574, 
p = 0.0160, Cohen's d = 1.46). This bilateral advantage 
was absent in the non-OTC group (bilateral: M = 0.140, SD = 0.085; unilateral: 
M = 0.131, SD = 0.077; paired t(8) = 0.328, p = 0.7511, 
d = 0.11). Controls showed a marginal bilateral advantage 
(bilateral: M = 0.259, SD = 0.073; unilateral: M = 0.149, SD = 0.063; paired 
t(8) = 2.671, p = 0.0283, d = 0.89).

Group Differences in Bilateral Advantage
To directly test our hypothesis, we computed bilateral advantage scores (bilateral 
minus unilateral representational change) for each participant and compared groups 
(Figure 1). The OTC group showed significantly greater bilateral advantage 
(M = 0.284, SD = 0.178) compared to the non-OTC group (M = 0.008, SD = 0.072; 
independent t(13) = 3.883, p = 0.0019, d = 2.05). 
The OTC advantage was marginally greater than controls (M = 0.110, SD = 0.117; 
t(13) = 2.129, p = 0.0530, d = 1.12).

Robustness Checks
Given the modest OTC sample size (n=6), we performed comprehensive robustness 
analyses. Non-parametric tests confirmed the parametric results: OTC showed 
greater bilateral advantage than non-OTC (Mann-Whitney U = 52.0, p = 0.002) and 
marginally greater advantage than controls (U = 42.0, p = 0.088). Permutation 
tests (10,000 iterations) yielded similar results (OTC vs. non-OTC: p = 0.001; 
OTC vs. controls: p = 0.043). Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for bilateral 
advantage showed no overlap between OTC [0.157, 0.435] and non-OTC [-0.038, 0.054]. 
Leave-one-out analysis demonstrated that the OTC versus control difference remained 
significant or marginal (p < 0.10) when removing any single OTC participant (range: 
p = 0.023 to p = 0.140), indicating the effect was not driven by a single outlier.

Mechanism: Enhanced Bilateral Category Plasticity
To understand the mechanism underlying the OTC group's bilateral advantage, we 
separately examined representational change in bilateral and unilateral categories. 
The OTC group showed significantly greater change in bilateral categories compared 
to controls (OTC: M = 0.419, SD = 0.149; controls: M = 0.259, SD = 0.073; 
t(13) = 2.562, p = 0.0237, d = 1.35). 
In contrast, unilateral category change did not differ between OTC and controls 
(OTC: M = 0.135, SD = 0.057; controls: M = 0.149, SD = 0.063; t(13) = -0.416, 
p = 0.6843, d = -0.22). This pattern indicates that OTC 
resection selectively enhanced plasticity for bilaterally represented categories 
while sparing unilateral category representations.

One-way ANOVA confirmed significant group differences in bilateral category 
representational change (F(2,21) = 11.99, p < 0.001) but not unilateral category 
change (F(2,21) = 0.15, p = 0.861), formally demonstrating the specificity of 
enhanced bilateral plasticity in the OTC group.
