1. ROI DEFINITION
   - Category-selective regions were defined using a functional localizer task
   - For each category (face, word, object, house), we identified the peak voxel 
     within an anatomical search mask at each timepoint
   - Search masks were defined per hemisphere and category (e.g., l_face_searchmask.nii.gz)
   - Peak voxel = voxel with maximum z-statistic for the relevant contrast within the search mask

2. PEAK COORDINATE EXTRACTION (following Golarai et al., 2007)
   - For each subject, session, hemisphere, and category, we extracted the MNI 
     coordinates of the peak voxel
   - Only peaks with z > 0 within the search mask were included
   - Coordinates were converted from voxel indices to MNI space using the affine transformation

3. SPATIAL VARIABILITY MEASUREMENT (following Golarai et al., 2007)
   - Euclidean distance was computed between T1 and T2 peak coordinates:
     Distance = sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)² + (z2-z1)²)
   - This unsigned measure captures spatial variability regardless of direction

4. SYSTEMATIC DRIFT TESTING (following Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2018)
   - Signed coordinate differences (T2 - T1) were computed for each axis:
     Δx (medial-lateral), Δy (anterior-posterior), Δz (superior-inferior)
   - One-sample t-tests against zero tested whether drift was systematic/directional
   - Non-significant results (p > 0.05) indicate peaks fluctuate randomly around a 
     stable location rather than drifting in a consistent direction

5. HEMISPHERE SELECTION
   - OTC/nonOTC patients: intact hemisphere only
   - Controls: right hemisphere for faces, left hemisphere for words (typical lateralization),
     both hemispheres for bilateral categories (object, house)

6. REORGANIZATION STATUS (OTC patients only, unilateral categories)
   - "Reorganizing": category normally lateralized to the RESECTED hemisphere
     • Faces in left hemisphere (RH-resection patients)
     • Words in right hemisphere (LH-resection patients)
   - "Typical": category in its native hemisphere
     • Faces in right hemisphere (LH-resection patients)  
     • Words in left hemisphere (RH-resection patients)

7. STATISTICAL COMPARISONS
   - Within-subject (OTC Reorganizing vs Typical): paired t-test
   - Between-group comparisons: independent samples t-tests
   - Overall group effects: one-way ANOVA
